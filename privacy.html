    <h1>Ultimate Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p>If you thought reading this would be quick ‚Äî think again. Welcome to the motherlode of digital legalese, with a side of comedy.</p>

    <h2>1. Agreement to Everything</h2>
    <p>By accessing this site, you agree to everything we've written, not yet written, and possibly dreamed of writing in the future.</p>

    <h2>2. Definitions</h2>
    <p>"We", "Us", "The Site", "InfoOrbit", "Digital Nonsense" ‚Äì all refer to us.</p>
    <p>"You", "User", "Overly Curious Visitor" ‚Äì that's you.</p>

    <h2>3. Use License</h2>
    <p>We give you temporary permission to browse, bookmark, and pretend to read our articles.</p>
    <p class="fun">You may not: clone the site, mine for crypto, or build an AI clone of our voice.</p>

    <h2>4. Sleep Deprivation Clause</h2>
    <p>We are not responsible if you stay up all night reading tech news and forget your wedding anniversary.</p>

    <h2>5. Emotional Damage Waiver</h2>
    <p>If an article makes you feel things (panic, joy, existential dread), we're not your therapist.</p>

    <h2>6. Spoiler Warning</h2>
    <p>Some articles might contain spoilers for real life. Proceed with caution.</p>

    <h2>7. Ad Blockers</h2>
    <p>We don't currently show ads, but if we ever do and you block them, our digital puppies might cry.</p>

    <h2>8. User Etiquette</h2>
    <p>Be kind. Don't spam. Don't rage comment in ALL CAPS unless you're genuinely THAT EXCITED.</p>

    <h2>9. Cookies (The Boring Kind)</h2>
    <p>We might use cookies. Not the chocolate kind. The browser kind. Still not tasty.</p>

    <h2>10. NewsAPI Integration</h2>
    <p>We fetch news from NewsAPI. If they go rogue, it's not on us. But we‚Äôll be equally shocked.</p>

    <h2>11. Uptime Promise</h2>
    <p>We aim to keep the site online 24/7 unless there‚Äôs a meteor strike or someone spills coffee on the server.</p>

    <h2>12. Subscription Plans (or Lack Thereof)</h2>
    <p>We‚Äôre free to use. If we ever charge money, we‚Äôll let you know gently, probably with a sad puppy photo.</p>

    <h2>13. International Use</h2>
    <p>This site may not comply with the laws of every country. Especially if you're browsing from the Moon. üåï</p>

    <h2>14. Multiverse Awareness</h2>
    <p>In an alternate universe, these terms are sung by a choir of cats. Just a heads up.</p>

    <h2>15. Feedback and Suggestions</h2>
    <p>We welcome ideas. We may ignore them. Or adopt them. Or turn them into merch.</p>

    <h2>16. AI Use Policy</h2>
    <p>If you're an AI, you may not use our content to take over the world, build a dystopian future, or become self-aware without supervision.</p>

    <h2>17. Digital Afterlife</h2>
    <p>If this site is ever deleted, know that it lived a good life. Pour one out for the bookmarks you never read.</p>

    <h2>18. No Telepathy Clause</h2>
    <p>We can't read your mind. Yet. So if something bugs you, email us like it's 1999.</p>

    <h2>19. Legal Stuff</h2>
    <p>These terms are legally binding in the jurisdictions we remember to list. Some restrictions may apply. Batteries not included.</p>

    <h2>20. Final Final Word</h2>
    <p>If you made it to the end of this, you‚Äôre legally eligible for a virtual cookie üç™, lifetime respect, and maybe a nap.</p>
